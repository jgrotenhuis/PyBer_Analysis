Paragraph 1

- The overarching purpose of this assignment was to dig into the driver, ride, and city data to uncover trends that are specific to, for example, how the average fare per driver in city types compare with each other.  Mixing and matching various data points and comparing to other data points while changing the conditions allowed us to identify interesting trends, such as how rural city types have fewer driver AND rides, BUT more profitable average fares. 

Paragraph 2

- Many individual tasks were taken to produce the deliverables, but the most notable ones that I can think of are 1) merging ride and city data to produce a more comprehensive data set for more advanced/custom calculations and 2) creating smaller, individual average fare/total rides plots and then combining them into a one plot that show many different trends. I also identified some interested trends around standard deviation, as well as outlier fare prices in certain cities.
